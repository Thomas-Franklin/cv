    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Software Development has had a paramount role in improving the lives of millions of people, even more so since
      the popularization of the internet. But there's still a lot left to do. Whilst the technical aspects are fundamntal,
      it's important to always keep in mind the human and organizational interactions that transform software into something
      useful, safe and beautiful. That's why I'm passionate not only about creating software, but also helping other people's
      develop their careers <strong>and</strong> learning a lot along the process, evidenced by the array of technology 
      stacks that I've worked with throughout my career.
      
      As an Individual Contributor, I've built a strong reputation of creating robust, stable, world class software 
      solutions during the last 12+ years. I specialize in best practices, accessibility security, automation and 
      telemetry. I have considerable experience in the Travel, Finance and Telecommunication industries.

      From a leadership standpoint, I help build and grow quality-driven, goal-oriented units that deliver 
      value, embrace measurable results, and collaborate effectively with partners. My teams help customers 
      achieve more, stakeholders be more effective, and fellow engineers become more productive, empowered and
      happier.
